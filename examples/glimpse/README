An HTML::EP example:	Using Glimpse for a simple search engine
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is an example I have created for the movie pages of a friend,
Anne Haasis.

The idea is using "glimpseindex" for building an index of your local
HTML pages and "glimpse" as the corresponding search engine.

If you like to use it, you are welcome, see Installation below, but

Installation
------------

  - Install the latest version of HTML::EP, perhaps the version from which
    you are reading this file.

  - Create an admin directory, perhaps password protected, and copy the
    files admin.ep, prefs.ep and to the admin directory.

  - Create a subdirectory admin/var (or choose another directory) within
    your web servers root directory, writable for the WWW server, and edit
    the above files, by adjusting the basedir path in the
    ep-html-ep-examples-glimpse statement. I use /home/httpd/html/EP/glimpse.

  - Create another directory and copy the files index.ep, advanced.ep and
    search.ep into it. Again, edit these files and adjust the basedir
    settings.

  - Point your browser to admin/admin.ep, enter the appropriate settings
    and save them. Create the index by calling admin/glimpseindex.ep.

  - That's it!
