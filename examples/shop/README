An HTML::EP example:	Shopping cart
-------------------------------------

This is an example I am about to create for a small german company,
IN.F.O. - Insider for Outside(r), Alexander Löffler.

It is far away from being complete, only the administration is done,
but I am submitting it anyways, as it demonstrates some usefull
examples, in particular upload and download of CSV files.

If you like to use it, you are welcome, see Installation below, but
note:

Installation
------------

  - In the root directory of your webserver, create a directory where the
    shop will live, I use /outdoor/shop.
  - Create a subdirectory var, make it writable for anyone, or at least
    the WWW user.
  - Prevent WWW access to this directory, for example by inserting a
    .htaccess file like

	order allow,deny
	deny from all

  - Create the CSV files you need, for example

        dbimon DBI:CSV:f_dir=/home/httpd/html/outdoor/shop
	dbimon> CREATE TABLE prefs (var VARCHAR(64), val BLOB)
        dbimon> CREATE TABLE articles (
		id VARCHAR(64),
		Artikel VARCHAR(64),
		Marke VARCHAR(64),
		Modell VARCHAR(64),
		Farbe VARCHAR(64),
		Groesse VARCHAR(64),
		Menge VARCHAR(64),
		Preis VARCHAR(64),
		BestellNr VARCHAR(64),
		Bemerkung VARCHAR(64),
		Textfeld VARCHAR(64))

	Make them writable by anyone, or at least the WWW server.
    	Of course you are free to use a real SQL engine by choosing
        another DSN.

  - Put the .ep files into the directory.

  - That's it!
